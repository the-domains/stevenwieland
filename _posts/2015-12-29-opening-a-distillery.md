Are you considering opening a distillery? To get the federal permits necessary to do so, you need three basic things:

* A location
* A business
* Equipment

Looking for a location? Talk to a commercial broker. 

Need to form a business? I can do that. Or you can probably figure it out too. It depends on how complex things will be. If it will include investors or multiple partners, talk to a lawyer.

As for the equipment, go to [Corson Distilling][0]. They'll build you a custom system right here in Boise, Idaho. No cheap foreign stuff. And they'll help you set up and maintain the still system. Then they'll show you how to use it to make awesome liquor. I also love Corson because they work well with attorneys to get you the federal permits you need.
