We focus a lot of our time on litigation, which is strange because we're not really combative people. Instead, we're assertive on behalf of the people we care about. And we care about clients more than anything.

Being pulled into a lawsuit feels like a massive, ominous storm system sweeping toward you sometimes. I can especially see it on the faces of clients who have never had to go to court before. It's especially scary for small business owners. They sometimes have a significant portion of their lives invested in case.
